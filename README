flac2alac is a shell script to convert FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) files to ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) format, used on iPod/iPhone/iPad.

You can use it to convert a single .flac file to .m4a, like

 flac2alac file.flac

flac2alac takes only one flac file as parameter (i.e. converts only one file per time). You can, however, convert all files in a given directory using a bash loop:

 for i in *flac ; do flac2alac "$i" ; done

A easy way to install on Linux is making it executable and copying it to a directory in your path, like

 chmod +x flac2alac && sudo cp flac2alac /usr/local/bin

flac2m4a uses flac and ffmpeg to decode/encode the audio files. On Ubuntu, you can install them with

 sudo apt-get install flac ffmpeg

Also required is the mpeg4ip package that includes the mp4tags utility, fetch it from here:

 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@mpeg4ip.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mpeg4ip login 
 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@mpeg4ip.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mpeg4ip co -P mpeg4ip

(their URL is http://mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net/downloads/index.php but they appear to have removed all tarball downloads.)
